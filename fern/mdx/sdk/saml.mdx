# SuperAgent Markup Language

SuperAgent Markup Language (SAML) is a powerful tool used in the SuperAgent framework. It allows developers to define and control the behavior of their agents in a structured and readable format. SAML is designed to be easy to use, yet flexible enough to handle complex scenarios. It provides a way to specify how an agent should respond to different types of user input, manage state, and interact with external APIs and services. With SAML, you can create agents that can handle a wide range of tasks, from simple FAQs to complex workflows involving multiple steps and external services. To use SAML, you define your agent's behavior in a SAML file, which is then processed by the SuperAgent framework. The framework interprets the SAML file and uses it to control the agent's behavior.

Below are all the available options:
